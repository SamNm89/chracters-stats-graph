## Privacy & Data

- **Local Storage**: Your character data, stats, and series are stored locally in your browser's `localStorage`. No data is sent to or stored on our servers.
- **Privacy**: Since all processing and storage happen on your own device, your data remains private and accessible only to you.
- **Cloud Sync**: If you choose to use the Google Drive Sync feature, your data is stored in your personal Google Drive account. We do not have access to your files.

## 🚀 Future Goals

The project is evolving into a comprehensive character lore and world-building tool. Planned features include:

- **Factions & Regions**: Assign characters to specific factions with custom logos and assign them to regional systems (planets, continents, and systems).
- **Interactive World Map**: A dynamic map view where character portraits are positioned across regions, allowing for visual storytelling of character distribution.
- **Weapon & Ability Database**: Dedicated zones for character inventories, including weapon catalogs with custom descriptions and detailed ability lists.
- **Achievement & Ranking System**: Integrated tracking for character milestones and world rankings.
- **Evolved UI Layouts**: A new "Lore View" where the radar graph takes a compact corner position to make room for detailed descriptions, while still allowing users to toggle back to the "Classic Graph View."
